I am participating in a Hackathon Challenge where I was told to Build an individual portfolio website.

Here is the complete details below:

```
Build a dynamic, individual portfolio website showcasing: 

Programming Languages: List the programming languages and frameworks you’re familiar with.
About Section: Tell us who you are and what drives you.
Educational Background: Include a section where visitors can download your CV.
Interests: Highlight your passions and what excites you in tech.
Projects: Link to the projects you’ve worked on.
Contact Form: Make it easy for potential employers or collaborators to get in touch with you.
Highlight your skills, projects, and passions.
```

Can I build this using only HTML and CSS?
