A great resource for finding emojis along with their Unicode values is Emojipedia. It provides a complete catalog of emojis, with details on each emoji’s:

Unicode Code Point: Listed in a format like U+1F600
Name and Description: Clear descriptions of the emoji's meaning and variations
Compatibility: Information on how each emoji appears across different platforms
Another option is the Unicode Consortium’s official emoji page, which lists emojis by category and Unicode version.
