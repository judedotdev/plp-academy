# All About Python Variables ðŸ§ ðŸ’¡

# 1. Assigning values to Variables in Python
site_name = "Power Learn Project"
print(site_name)

# 2. Changing the Value of a Variable in Python
# Assigning new value to site_name
site_name = "I love coding ðŸ˜Š"
print(site_name)

# The output will be
# Power Learn Project
# I love coding ðŸ˜Š

# 3. Example: Assigning multiple values to multiple variables
a,b,c = 5, 7, "Hello world"
print(a) # prints 5
print(b) # prints 5
print(c) # prints Hello World

4. Rules for Naming Python Variables
Constant and variable names should have a combination of letters in
lowercase (a to z) or uppercase (A to Z) or digits (0 to 9) or an underscore (_).

For example:

snake_case
MACRO_CASE
camelCase
CapsWords

Python is case-sensitive. So num and Num are different variables.
For example:

num = 55
Num = 510
print(num) #5
print(Num) #510

# Avoid using keywords like if, True, class, etc. as variable names.
"""

num = 55
Num = 510
print(num) # 5
print(Num) # 510
